# Assignment_Covid-19_Report


Create a simple UI that lists all the continents. The continents should expand when clicked

Each continent can have a + symbol or a small button.

When the ‘+’ symbol is clicked, it should expand and display a table with all the countries and their population and total covid cases.

Include a search functionality in the page to search by country. When searched by country, the page should display the details of the 

country.
